    "Use 4-layer architecture: Presentation (UI), State Management, Business Logic (Services), Data layer.",

    "Recommended state management: Riverpod or Provider; avoid heavy setState in large-scale app.",
    "Recommended pattern: UI -> Provider -> Service -> Database.",
    "Encryption module uses AES-256; encryption key stored in secure storage; encrypt notes before saving and decrypt on retrieval.",
    "NLP expected output structure includes date/time/confidence; NLP can be local (PyThaiNLP via backend) or API-based.",
    "Database options considered: SQLite (sqflite) recommended for thesis alignment; cloud options include Supabase/Firebase."
